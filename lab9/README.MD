# CMPE202 Lab9 - Lambda

## Refactored Design Pattern 

#### Strategy Pattern: 
My example for strategy pattern is to sort and print numbers in ascending or descending order.  
Two strategies used are:
1. Ascending Order Strategy
2. Descending Order Strategy

##### Advantages
1. By implementing lambda function makes the code less verbose and very concise. 
2. The number of classes are reduced from 5 to 2 also, code is more readable. 
3. Lambda expressions work great because the behavior to execute is simple, so theyâ€™re helpful to remove boilerplate code.

#### Adapter Pattern
My Adapter pattern example is from Paul's adapter design pattern example. Where target object is using Adaptee object to print "Hello" Message. 

##### Advantages
1. The code is more readable. 
2. Class numbers are reduced from 5 to 3. 
3. Boiler plate code is reduced.
